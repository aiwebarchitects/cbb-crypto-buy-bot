- ✅ **Buy the dip** automatically
- ✅ **Dollar-cost average** into crypto positions

## 🔍 How It Works

### 📊 The Strategy

5. **Repeats** every 60 seconds

### 💡 Why This Works

### Step 4: Configure the Bot

Open the file `executer/config.json` and update it:

```json
{
    "secret_key": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE",
    "account_address": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_HERE",
    "multi_sig": {
        "authorized_users": [
            {
                "comment": "signer 1",
                "secret_key": "",
                "account_address": ""

```
